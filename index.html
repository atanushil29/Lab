<p>To design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer connecting the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments,
follow these steps. We'll create a basic network topology with two departments, each containing
at least two computers, and ensure that they can ping each other using the given network address
192.168.40.0. We'll use Cisco Packet Tracer for this example.

1. Create the Network Topology:
   Use Packet Tracer to create a new project and add devices to your topology. You'll need the following components:
    
    - 2 Computers for the ACCOUNTS department.
    - 2 Computers for the DELIVERY department.
    - 2 Switches (one for each department).
    - 1 Router to connect the two departments.

2. Assign IP Addresses:

    You should assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to each device. In this example,
	we'll use the 192.168.40.0 network.

    - For the ACCOUNTS department:
        - Computer 1: IP 192.168.40.1 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.40.254
        - Computer 2: IP 192.168.40.2 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.40.254
		
    - For the DELIVERY department:
        - Computer 1: IP 192.168.41.3 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.41.254
        - Computer 2: IP 192.168.41.4 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.41.254

    - Router:
        - Connect the Router's FastEthernet interface to both switches.
        - Configure two sub-interfaces on the Router's FastEthernet interface.
            - Sub-interface for VLAN1 (ACCOUNTS):
                - IP 192.168.40.254 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0)
            - Sub-interface for VLAN2 (DELIVERY):
                - IP 192.168.41.254 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0)

3. Test Connectivity:
    You should be able to ping between computers in the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments now. 
	For example, from a computer in the ACCOUNTS department, you should be able to ping computers in the DELIVERY 
	department and vice versa.

This setup segregates the two departments into different VLANs, allowing them to communicate through the router.
The router serves as a gateway between the two VLANs, allowing traffic to flow between them while keeping them 
logically separate.</p>
