        - Computer 1: IP 192.168.41.3 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.41.254
        - Computer 2: IP 192.168.41.4 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0), Gateway 192.168.41.254
    - Router:
        - Connect the Router's FastEthernet interface to both switches.
        - Configure two sub-interfaces on the Router's FastEthernet interface.
            - Sub-interface for VLAN1 (ACCOUNTS):
                - IP 192.168.40.254 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0)
            - Sub-interface for VLAN2 (DELIVERY):
                - IP 192.168.41.254 /24 (Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0)
3. Test Connectivity:
    You should be able to ping between computers in the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments now. 
	For example, from a computer in the ACCOUNTS department, you should be able to ping computers in the DELIVERY 
	department and vice versa.
This setup segregates the two departments into different VLANs, allowing them to communicate through the router.
The router serves as a gateway between the two VLANs, allowing traffic to flow between them while keeping them 
logically separate.</p>
